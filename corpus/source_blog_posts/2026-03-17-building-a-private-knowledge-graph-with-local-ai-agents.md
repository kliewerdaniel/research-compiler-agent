# Building a Private Knowledge Graph with Local AI Agents

## The Future of Data Sovereignty is Local

I've just completed building a comprehensive knowledge graph and vector database entirely on my local machine using Mistral Vibe as a coding agent. This setup demonstrates how we can achieve full data sovereignty while still leveraging the power of AI assistants.

## The Problem: Cloud Dependence

Most AI assistant workflows today require sending your data to cloud services. Even when working with local models, the orchestration and knowledge management often happens through external platforms. This creates several issues:

1. **Data privacy concerns**: Sensitive information leaves your machine
2. **Internet dependency**: You need connectivity to work with AI
3. **Vendor lock-in**: Your knowledge is tied to specific platforms
4. **Latency issues**: Network calls slow down interactions

## The Solution: Fully Local Knowledge Infrastructure

I've built a system that:
- Runs entirely on my local machine
- Uses local AI models (devstralsmall2 with Mistral Vibe)
- Maintains all data in a structured knowledge graph
- Enables semantic search via vector embeddings
- Provides fast, private access to information

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Knowledge Graph Structure

The system organizes information into entities and relationships:

```
Users → (authored) → Comments → (belongs_to) → Subreddits
Users → (authored) → Submissions → (belongs_to) → Subreddits
Messages → (part_of) → Conversations
Content → (discusses) → Topics
```

### 2. Vector Database

Each entity has a semantic vector embedding using Sentence Transformers, enabling:
- Similarity search across content
- Semantic understanding of relationships
- Efficient nearest-neighbor queries

### 3. Local Agent Integration

Mistral Vibe operates as a coding agent that:
- Reads and writes files locally
- Queries the knowledge graph via index.json
- Performs vector similarity searches
- Maintains full data sovereignty

## Implementation Details

### Knowledge Graph Structure

```
bank/
├── kb/                          # Knowledge Graph & Vector DB

├── entities/                    # Source data
│   ├── comments.md              # 2,178 comments
│   ├── submissions.md           # 676 submissions

└── domains/                     # Domain-specific content
    ├── reddit/                  # Reddit content
    └── openai/                  # OpenAI conversations
```

### Index Structure

The `index.json` provides fast lookup:

```json
{
  "users": {
    "konradfreeman": {
      "entity": "user:konradfreeman",
      "comments": ["Agents_m26gwn1", "Agents_m2c5g80", ...],
      "submissions": [...],
      "subreddits": ["AI", "AskReddit", ...]
    }
  },
  "subreddits": {
    "AI": {
      "entity": "subreddit:AI",
      "comments": [...],
      "submissions": [...],
      "users": [...]
    }
  },
  "entity_types": ["user", "comment", "submission", "subreddit", "conversation", "message", "topic"],
  "relationship_types": ["authored", "belongs_to", "part_of", "discusses", "related_to"]
}
```

## Query Examples

### Graph Queries (Structural)

```bash
# Find all comments by a user
cat bank/kb/index.json | jq '.users["konradfreeman"].comments | length'
# Output: 2178

# Find all content in a subreddit
cat bank/kb/index.json | jq '.subreddits["AI"].comments | length'
# Output: 1045

# Get specific comment content
grep -A 15 "## Agents_m26gwn1" bank/entities/comments.md
```

### Vector Queries (Semantic)

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Load model locally
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Encode query
query = "Find comments about AI agents"
query_vector = model.encode(query)

# Find similar content
results = find_similar(query_vector, k=5)
# Returns semantically similar comments with scores
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Index size**: ~50KB (JSON)
- **Query time**: <1ms (jq), <100ms (grep)
- **Vector search**: <10ms (HNSW)
- **Memory usage**: Minimal for text files
- **No internet required**: All operations local

## Benefits of This Approach

mkdir -p bank/kb/{entities,relationships,schema,vector_db/{embeddings,index,metadata}}

# Create initial index
python3 create_index.py
```

### Adding Content

```python
# Parse your data into entities
from knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph

kg = KnowledgeGraph()

# Add users
kg.add_user("your_username", "Your Name", contributions=[...])

# Add content
kg.add_comment("comment_id", "your_username", "subreddit_name", "content...")

# Build index
kg.build_index()
```

### Creating Vector Embeddings

```python
from vector_db import VectorDatabase

db = VectorDatabase()

# Create embeddings for all entities
db.create_embeddings("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Build search index
db.build_index()
```

## The Future: Local AI Ecosystems

This setup represents the future of AI-assisted work:

1. **Local models**: Powerful AI running on your machine
2. **Local knowledge**: Structured data that never leaves your device
3. **Local agents**: AI assistants that work with your private data
4. **Local workflows**: Complete toolchains running entirely offline

## Challenges and Considerations

### Hardware Requirements

## Conclusion

Building a private knowledge graph with local AI agents provides unparalleled data sovereignty while maintaining the power and flexibility of modern AI systems. This approach:

- Keeps all your data private and secure
- Works offline without internet dependency
- Provides fast, local access to information
- Enables powerful semantic search capabilities
- Gives you complete control over your knowledge

The future of AI assistance isn't in the cloud - it's on your local machine, where you have full control and complete privacy.

## Next Steps

1. **Experiment**: Try running a local model with Mistral Vibe
2. **Build**: Create your own knowledge graph structure
3. **Integrate**: Connect tools to your local data
4. **Automate**: Set up workflows that work entirely offline
5. **Share**: Contribute to the growing ecosystem of local AI tools

The tools are here. The models are capable. Now it's time to build the future of private, local AI assistance.
